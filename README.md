# Predictive Model for Food Prices in 2022 using Support Vector Machine Algorithm
- This project focuses on analyzing food prices in 2022 using various data science techniques and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.
- The project follows standard data science steps such as data collection, data cleaning, data exploration, and data visualization to extract useful insights from the data.
- The SVM algorithm is then used to build a predictive model to forecast food prices for the year 2022 in Pakistan.

# Dataset
The dataset that we used is from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amaanfaheem/pakistan-food-prices-2022?resource=download).
The dataset contains food prices data for Pakistan, sourced from the World Food Programmed Price Database.
